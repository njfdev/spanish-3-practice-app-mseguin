# Ms. Eguin's Spanish 3 Conjugation Practice

This _little_ website was made to practice for my **weekly Spanish 3 verb conjugation quizzes** in school. It pulls the current verbs, definitions, and conjugation tenses from a Google Spreadsheet and then _generates_ questions to practice with. So far, this website has allowed me to get a _perfect_ score on my first 5 weekly practice quizzes.

> **Fun Fact:** Ms. Eguin is neither me nor my teacher. Rather, it is an _intentional_ misspelling of my Spanish teacher's name for a funny inside joke.
